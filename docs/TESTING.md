# Solution Testing

Unit tests help determine the correctness of the source code at a modular level.

Scripts are provided to make certain tasks beyond the scope of the source code easier.

## Scripts

The `<project root>/scripts` directory holds Bash scripts to emulate proxies on the local machine using Docker.

* `install-proxy-image.sh` installs the Proxy container image from the included tarball â€“ please do not move the tarball!

* `start-proxies.sh <#>` instantiates the said # of proxy containers on the local machine, producing a `proxies.txt` file (of proxy addresses) in the working directory from which the script is called.

* `kill-proxies.sh` purges all proxy containers from Docker, removing the `proxies.txt` file in the working directory from which the script is called.

## Unit Tests

This codebase relies on the `jest` package to run unit tests. Unit test implementations end in `.test.ts`.

To run the unit tests, simply execute the command: `npm test`
